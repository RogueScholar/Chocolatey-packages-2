## Multibit
MultiBit is a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) Bitcoin desktop client.

* Maven as the build system, so the usual Maven processes apply. If you're not familiar with Maven 
    then download it first and follow their installation instructions.
* ZXing ("Zebra Crossing") for QR codes
* Bitcoinj for access to the Bitcoin network
* IzPack for creating installers for Windows, Mac, Linux
* Bitcoinj Enforcer Rules to prevent dependency chain attacks
* XChange for access to several Bitcoin exchanges

#### MultiBit editions
* MultiBit Classic (this package) - free, open source
* [MultiBit HD](https://chocolatey.org/packages/multibit-hd) - pay-to-send, open source - offers 
    additional security for a very small fee

Please note Bitcoin Solutions Ltd is not focusing further development on MultiBit Classic (installed 
by this package) and only essential security and network compatibility updates will be made to the codebase.
