##The vSphere Client is the principal interface for administering vCenter Server and ESXi.

The vSphere Client user interface is configured based on the server to which it is connected:

* When the server is a vCenter Server system, the vSphere Client displays all the options available to the vSphere environment, according to the licensing configuration and the user permissions.

* When the server is an ESXi host, the vSphere Client displays only the options appropriate to single host management.

When you first log in to the vSphere Client, it displays a Home page with icons that you select to access vSphere Client functions. When you log out of the vSphere Client, the client application retains the view that was displayed when it closed, and returns you to that view when you next log in.

You perform many management tasks from the Inventory view, which consists of a single window containing a menu bar, a navigation bar, a toolbar, a status bar, a panel section, and pop-up menus.
