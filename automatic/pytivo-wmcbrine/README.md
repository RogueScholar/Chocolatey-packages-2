pyTivo is both an HMO and GoBack server. Similar to TiVo Desktop, pyTivo loads many standard video compression codecs and outputs mpeg2 (or in some cases, h.264) video to the TiVo. However, pyTivo is able to load many more file types than TiVo Desktop.
pyTivo is in no way affiliated with TiVo, Inc.

####Features
* Output 4:3 or 16:9 and pad your video if needed.
* Transfer compatible video files without transcoding.
* Transfer TiVo recordings (.tivo) from computer to TiVo.
* Display Metadata about your video.
* Serve Music and Photos through the HMO protocol
* Support for Windows, Linux, and Mac	

This is the wmcbrine fork.
