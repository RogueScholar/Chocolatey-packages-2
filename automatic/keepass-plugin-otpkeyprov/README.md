## KeePass Plugin OtpKeyProv
OtpKeyProv is a key provider based on one-time passwords. After protecting your database using this
plugin, you need to generate and enter one-time passwords in order to open your database.

All generator tokens that follow the OATH HOTP standard ([RFC 4226](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt)) are supported.

If you instead want KeePass to generate one-time passwords, see the [{HMACOTP}](https://keepass.info/help/base/placeholders.html#hmacotp) placeholder.

For generating time-based OTPs, see [KeeOtp](https://chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-keeotp) and [Tray TOTP](https://chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-traytotp) plugins.
