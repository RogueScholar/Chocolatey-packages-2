    <description><![CDATA[## Executor
Executor is a multi purpose launcher and a more advanced and customizable version of windows run. 
The program originated as I was sick of spending too much time searching for programs through my 
ever growing windows start-menu, and also I missed a tool that could ease and optimize my daily 
work flow. There was of course already programs like this available, but each had it's annoyance 
or missing features or too(!) geeky.
