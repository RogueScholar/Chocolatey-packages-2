Unlocking, rooting, relocking and unrooting simplified! (and much more!)

VERSION 2.1.9 – This program will automatically bring together all the files you need to unlock and root your device in a few clicks, or flash it back to stock and re-lock it. You can also use this program to backup/restore all your important data, flash zips, set file permissions, push and pull files, install apps, generate logcats/bugreports, and much more! With the included file association options, you can perform tasks like flashing zips, installing apps, restoring android backup files, and flashing/booting img files with just a double click! The program includes a full featured interface for automating tasks in TWRP, enhanced restore features, an in-built auto-updater/notification system, ‘any build’ mode, advanced restore features,’NRT- Live Log’ for viewing the adb/fastboot cmds that are run in the background, quick tools utilities, utility set for merging custom build.prop tweaks, and tools for taking screenshots/screen-recordings.   All the latest official Android builds and Nexus devices are supported.  The program intelligently and selectively downloads the files it needs for your device and makes sure you are using the latest files available.  The program can even auto-detect your device and build.  This release brings official support for the new ZIP style factory packages.   Check out the updated changelog for a more comprehensive breakdown of the feature set and changes in this release.
