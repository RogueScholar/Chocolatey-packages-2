## Rufus (portable)
Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives, such as USB
keys/pendrives, memory sticks, etc.

It can be especially useful for cases where:

* you need to create USB installation media from bootable ISOs (Windows, Linux, UEFI, etc.)
* you need to work on a system that doesn't have an OS installed
* you need to flash a BIOS or other firmware from DOS
* you want to run a low-level utility

Despite its small size, Rufus provides everything you need!

Oh, and Rufus is fast. For instance it's about twice as fast as UNetbootin, Universal USB Installer
or Windows 7 USB download tool, on the creation of a Windows 7 USB installation drive from an ISO.
It is also marginally faster on the creation of Linux bootable USB from ISOs.
