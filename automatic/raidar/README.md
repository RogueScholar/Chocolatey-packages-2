RAIDar is a software application that you use to discover ReadyDATA systems on the network. RAIDar is included on the Resource CD that came with your system. It includes versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. RAIDar is also available at www.netgear.com/readydata.

RAIDar displays the discovered ReadyDATA units with their status LED icons. The volume, disk, UPS, and fan LED icons are not operational for the ReadyDATA.
