## PSLab Desktop
 It is using ElectronJS running React on top as UI renderer and uses Python scripts under the hood
 for device communication. The goal of PSLab is to create an Open Source hardware device (open on
 all layers) and software applications that can be used for experiments by teachers, students and
 scientists. Our tiny pocket lab provides an array of instruments for doing science and engineering
 experiments. It provides functions of numerous measurement tools including an oscilloscope, a
 waveform generator, a frequency counter, a programmable voltage, current source and even a component
 to control robots with up to four servos. Our website is at [PSLab.io](https://pslab.io/). See also the [screenshots and demos](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-desktop/blob/development/docs/screenshots-and-demos.md).
