    <description><![CDATA[## TeamSpeak Server

TeamSpeak offers the ideal tool for online gaming, education and training, internal business communication, and staying in touch with friends and family. Our primary focus is delivering a solution that is easy to use, with high security standards, excellent voice quality, and low system and bandwidth usage. Featuring a client-server architecture, TeamSpeak is literally capable of handling up to thousands of simultaneous users.

### How it Works
Host your own TeamSpeak Server or rent one from an Authorized TeamSpeak Host Provider (ATHP). Share your TeamSpeak Server address with friends, teammates, or anyone you want to chat with. Using the free desktop client, they connect to your TeamSpeak Server using the address you provide them. Start talking. It's that easy!

### Key Features
The TeamSpeak Client and Server provide unmatched functionality for both beginners and advanced users. Packed with powerful features and incredible performance, TeamSpeak is your Swiss Army Knife of voice communication.	

#### SUPERIOR VOICE QUALITY
Integrated automatic microphone volume adjustment, background noise reduction, and echo cancellation ensures crystal clear communication.

#### HIGH SCALABILITY
Client-Server architecture allows you to scale from small group conversations to large conferences with thousands of participants.

#### PRIVACY BUILT-IN
All TeamSpeak products are designed with your privacy in mind. We not track your voice or text chat data and there is no sign-up required.

#### POWERFUL FILE TRANSFER
Maximize your online collaborative experience. Store and share files directly on the server without having to mess with firewall issues.

#### TEXT CHAT
No need for additional private messaging software. Use TeamSpeak to send text messages to others in your channel or in a 1-on-1 private chat.

#### ROBUST PERMISSION SYSTEM
With our powerful hierarchical permission system, you are in complete control. Decide who can talk, who can join channels and much more.

#### STUNNING 3D SOUND EFFECTS
TeamSpeak features Positional Audio support. Place conference hosts in front of the attendees or team mates around your own player position.

#### DECENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE
Rent a TeamSpeak Server from an Authorized TeamSpeak Host Provider (ATHP) or host a server yourself on your hardware or VPS.

#### MOBILE CONNECTIVITY
Stay connected when you're on the go. With our mobile TeamSpeak apps for Android and iOS, you can access your servers and data at all times.
