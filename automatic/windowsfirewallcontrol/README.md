## Windows Firewall Control - Managing Windows Firewall is now easier than ever
Program Overview

Windows Firewall Control is a powerful tool which extends the functionality of 
Windows Firewall and provides new extra features which makes Windows Firewall 
better. It runs in the system tray and allows the user to control the native 
firewall easily without having to waste time by navigating to the specific part 
of the firewall. This is the best tool to manage the native firewall from 
Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Server 2012, Server 2016, Server 2019, Server 2022. 
Windows Firewall Control offers four filtering modes which can be switched
with just a mouse click:

High Filtering - All outbound and inbound connections are blocked. This profile 
blocks all attempts to connect to and from your computer.
Medium Filtering - Outbound connections that do not match a rule are blocked. 
Only the programs that you allow can initiate outbound connections.
Low Filtering - Outbound connections that do not match a rule are allowed. The 
user can block the programs he doesn't want to allow initiating outbound connections.
No Filtering - Windows Firewall is turned off. Avoid using this setting unless 
you have another firewall running on your computer.

Windows Firewall Control doesn't do any packet filtering and does not block or 
allow any connection. This is done by Windows Firewall itself based on the 
existing firewall rules.
