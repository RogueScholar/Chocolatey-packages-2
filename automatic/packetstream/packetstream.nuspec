    <description><![CDATA[## PacketStream
PacketStream's multi-hop proxy tunnel enables businesses automation tooling to access more reliable data and unlock geolocation-restricted content.
Access the network with your existing data-collection tooling, or use one of PacketStream's marketplace apps.

Packeters share their un-utilized bandwidth with the PacketStream network and get paid for participating.
The PacketStream service measures the amount of bandwidth shared and credits your account accordingly.
