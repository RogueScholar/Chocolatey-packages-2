## NewFileTime
NewFileTime is a small portable but effective tool that provides you easy access to correct or manipulate any of the timestamps for any file and folder on your Windows system. 

Several files and/or folders can be modified at the same time. You can add files simply via Drag and Drop or by import from a folder. In any case, it opens in different ways to bring you quickly to the job at hand. You can make files proportionally younger or older, or you can set a specific date/time. 

With this utility everyone can have the ability to make quick corrections to the creation, last access and modification dates/times of the files or folders on their PC. NewFileTime does not have to be installed and can be executed easily from the desktop. Portable use is also possible.
