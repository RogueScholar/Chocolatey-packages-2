## NetStat Agent – Fast Lookup Tool for Available TCP/UDP Connections

Whenever you open a website connection through your browser or download files, you are opening TCP/UDP connections. TCP/UDP connections link your client computer to the remote host machine which may be local or out in the cloud.

The big problem is knowing what available connections you have available on your own computer. Opening TCP/UDP connections is essential if you are to master control over your network, but you need to take the guesswork out of the equation in order to manage resources effectively.

## Now you can with NetStat Agent

NetStat Agent provides a fast and easy way to establish what ports and connections are available from your client computer. In addition, you are able to simply monitor what existing connections are currently being made and diagnose connectivity issues without delay.
