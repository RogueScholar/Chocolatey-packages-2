    <description><![CDATA[## KeePass Quick Unlock
KeePass Quick Unlock is a plug-in for KeePass 2.x which lets you re-open your database without your full 
password. If you want to re-open your database, you can type just a few characters (by default, the 
first 3 characters of your password) to unlock quickly and easily! If the wrong QuickUnlock key is 
entered, the database keeps locked and the full password is required to re-open.

This plugin doesn't change the way how KeePass encrypts your database so your passwords are still safe.
For more informations why this plugin doesn't break safety, 
read http://keepass.info/help/base/security.html#secspecattacks
