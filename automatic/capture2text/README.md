## Capture2Text
Capture2Text enables users to quickly OCR a small portion of the screen and, by default, save the result to the clipboard. Capture2Text can OCR 50+ languages. By default only the following languages are installed:

* English
* French
* German
* Italian
* Japanese 
* Spanish

To acquire other languages:

1. Download the appropriate OCR language dictionaries from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/capture2text/files/Dictionaries/
2. Extract the ".zip" file you just downloaded with 7-Zip or similar decompression software.
3. Drag all files contained within the zip file to this path in the Capture2Text directory: `$Env:ChocolateyInstall\lib\capture2text\Capture2Text\Utils\tesseract\tessdata`
4. Restart Capture2Text

Note: Arabic and Hindi are more CPU intensive and will thus be slower to OCR.

To install the Chinese (NHocr) language pack:

1. Download nhocr from: https://sourceforge.jp/projects/nhocr/
2. Open it with 7-Zip and copy `PLM-zh_CN.dic` and `cctable-zh_CN` to `$Env:ChocolateyInstall\lib\capture2text\Capture2Text\Utils\nhocr\Dic`
3. Restart Capture2Text
