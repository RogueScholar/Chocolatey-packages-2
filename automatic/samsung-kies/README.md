Samsung Kies creates a bridge between your phone and desktop computer. Kies connects the devices via USB cable or Wifi. Whether itâ€™s managing your music, photos, videos, downloading podcasts or creating a safety backup of your contacts and calendars, Kies combines all of these features in a fresh and easy to use interface. Playlists can be created and synchronized across different devices and platforms including iTunes. To keep your phone up to date, Kies lets you download applications, e.g. from Samsung App Store, and firmwares to install them on your phone instantly. Kies Air is the smartphone version of the program that brings the experience to your phone, too.
