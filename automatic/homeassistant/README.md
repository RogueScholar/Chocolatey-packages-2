Awaken your home

Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi or a local server.

### Observe

Home Assistant will track the state of all the devices in your home, so you don't have to.

### Control

Control all your devices from a single, mobile-friendly, interface.

Home Assistant allows you to control all your devices without storing any of your data in the cloud. We like to keep your privacy private.

### Automate

Set up advanced rules to control devices and bring your home alive.

Do you want to â€¦

* have the lights turn on when the sun sets and you are home?
* have the lights turn on when anyone comes home and it is dark?
* dim the lights when you start watching a movie on your Chromecast?
* receive a message when the lights turn on while you are not at home?
