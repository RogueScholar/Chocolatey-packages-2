## Eagle
The EAGLE (__E__asily __A__pplicable __G__raphical __L__ayout __E__ditor) Light Edition is 
an easy to use, yet powerful tool for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs).

The program consists of three main modules: Layout Editor, Schematic Editor, and Autorouter.

#### Freeware with limitations
