## Hardware Freak

Hardware Freak is a free system information utility designed to present you a lot of information about the hardware found inside your PC. This tool will give you information about the CPU, BIOS, Motherboard, RAM Memory, Graphics card, Sound card, Hard Drive, External storage devices, Operating system, Optical Media, Networking, Printers, Keyboard, Mouse and USB Ports. 

If u ever had any question about any of the listed components, this utility will provide you with the answer, giving you the full picture about your system. 

Hardware Freak is now faster and lighter than ever!!

::Version 2.0::

So, what's new?

1) System Summary was added-> Now, in the end of your system test, "Hardware Freak" will generate a short report, including the most important information about your system, and you can add/edit this report before saving it to your system as a text file.

2) Battery information was added-> for those of you who have laptops and want more information about the battery, including information about the battery capacity, chemistry, charge rate, status, model, and more...

3) Better hard drive information -> Hardware Freak can now show you the temperature of your hard drive. Your hard drive must have S.M.A.R.T support for this feature to work.

4) Hardware Freak Advisor (Beta) is now included -> This feature is designed for people who don't have much knowledge about PC hardware. The idea behind it is to simply translate hardware stuff into words, so that people without much knowledge in computers could get a better idea about their system. This feature is still in beta edition and for now it supports Intel CPUs only. You might encouter bugs so please report them to hanna.naom@gmail.com.

5) Hardware Freak now can run in your system background. If you want hardware freak to stay opened, you can go to options-> Run in background when minimized. This will remove Hardware Freak from your taskbar and add an icon to the notifications zone. Double click the icon to open hardware freak again. You can always disable this feature by clicking on the option again. This feature can be extremly useful when you want to keep track of your CPU usage, clock, RAM usage and HDD temperature.

6) You can add Hardware Freak to your system startup. Just go to Options-> Open hardware freak on startup. You can also delete hardware Freak from your startup by performing the same step again.

7) Bugs and mistakes were fixed.
