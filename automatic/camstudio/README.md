CamStudio records screen and audio activity on your computer to create AVI video files and turns them into bandwidth-friendly, streaming Flash videos (SWF). CamStudio also lets you add screen captions or video annotations to your recordings through anti-aliased images, or by producing a Webcam movie of yourself (screen in screen) on your desktop. And CamStudio comes with its own lossless codec that produces crystal clear results with a much smaller filesize compared some popular codecs, like Microsoft Video 1. Additional options include cursor controls, the ability to record an entire screen or a portion of it, and selections for output quality. Best of all, CamStudio is easy to use and navigate, plus it includes a built-in Help file.
