## Powder Player
Torrents have always been the symbol of freedom of information on the internet, our target is ease of access to this sea of information in an ever growing technological world.

We believe the complexity of using a Video Player and a Torrent Client separately has become unnecessary, so we have created an application that merges the two types 
of software in a feature rich, simple to use player for your convenience.

Powder is the future of all torrent requirements, it's a hybrid between a Torrent Client (Peerflix) and a Customized Player (WebChimera.js).
