## SD-Card-formatter
The SD Memory Card Formatter formats SD Memory Card, SDHC Memory Card and SDXC Memory Card (respectively
SD/SDHC/SDXC Cards) complying with the SD File System Specification created by the SD Association (SDA).

It is strongly recommended to use the SD Memory Card Formatter to format SD/SDHC/SDXC Cards rather than
using formatting tools provided with individual operating systems. In general, formatting tools provided
with operating systems can format various storage media including SD/SDHC/SDXC Cards, but it may not be 
ptimized for SD/SDHC/SDXC Cards and it may result in lower performance.

SD/SDHC/SDXC Cards have a “Protected Area” for SD Card security purposes. The SD Memory Card Formatter
does not format the protected area in the SD/SDHC/SDXC Cards. The protected area shall be formatted by
an appropriate PC application or SD host devices that provide SD security function.

The SD Memory Card Formatter doesn't support SD/SDHC/SDXC Card encrypted by the “BitLocker To Go"
functionality of Windows. Please format the SD/SDHC/SDXC Card after it has been unlocked.
