## Multibit HD
MultiBit Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet is an open source desktop Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (HDW) for Bitcoin using the Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) mode to provide very fast blockchain synchronization for a modest pay-to-send fee.

The target audience is "international mainstream" which compels the user interface to remain as simple and consistent as possible while still retaining advanced capabilities under the covers.
