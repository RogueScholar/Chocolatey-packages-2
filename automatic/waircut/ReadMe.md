## Wireless Air Cut

Wireless Air Cut is a WPS wireless, portable and free network audit software for Ms Windows.

It is used to check the security of our wps wireless networks and to detect possible security breaches.
You can check if the router has a generic and known wps pin set, if it is vulnerable to a brute-force attack or is vulnerable to a Pixie-Dust attack.

You can see the Installation instructions on Wiki.
