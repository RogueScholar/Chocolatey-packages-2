### Your customers count on you.
### You can count on us. 

Protect your servers, applications, workstations and critical business documents. No appliances. No separate storage costs.  Pricing is simple and based on devices.

The SolarWinds Backup management console is unique. The customizable dashboard provides at-a-glance status and fast issue resolution in just a few clicks. 
 
Increase your efficiency using deduplication - the full dataset for any system is backed up only once. Every backup afterward is incremental, updating only what’s changed—minimizing bandwidth usage and optimizing storage for your clients. 

SpeedVault, a local cache capability, gives you the option to help recover data in minutes and meet, or better yet, exceed your Recovery Time Objectives (RTO).
