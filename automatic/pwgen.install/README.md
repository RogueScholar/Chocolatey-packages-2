PWGen is a professional password generator capable of creating large amounts of cryptographically-secure passwords
or passphrases consisting of words from a word list. It uses a “random pool” technique to generate random data
based on user inputs (keystrokes, mouse handling) and volatile system parameters. pwgen.install provides lots of options
to customize passwords to the users’ various needs. Additionally, it offers strong text encryption and the creation
of random data files (e.g., key files).
