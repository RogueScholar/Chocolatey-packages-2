## Opus-tools
Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec. Opus is unmatched for interactive
speech and music transmission over the Internet, but is also intended for storage and streaming
applications. It is standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 6716 which
incorporated technology from Skype's SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.
