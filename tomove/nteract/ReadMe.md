## nteract
nteract is a literate coding environment that supports Python, R, JavaScript and other Jupyter kernels. 
It wraps up the best of the web based Jupyter notebook and embeds it as a desktop application that allows
you to open notebooks natively on your system.

Use either with Python v2 or Python v3, standalone or within Anaconda/Miniconda distributions. This package 
also tries to enable the default IPython kernel for your system:

 * `python -m pip install ipykernel` or `conda install ipykernel`
 * `python -m ipykernel install --user`
