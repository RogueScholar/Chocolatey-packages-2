1Password is a password manager that keeps you safe online. You want to use different passwords for every website, but it can be hard to keep track of them all. With 1Password you only ever need to memorize…one password. All your other passwords and important information are protected behind the one password only you know.

1Password manages everything for you: generating, saving, and filling your passwords. Get to know 1Password in your browser:

About your privacy:

1Password was designed with a deep respect for your privacy. The data you save is encrypted and inaccessible to us. Anything else is only ever used to provide you with service and support.

We believe strongly that your data is yours, and we don’t want to know anything about it. This is one of the fundamental beliefs 1Password was built upon.

That’s why our privacy policy is simple: your data is your data. We don’t use it, we don’t share it, and we don’t sell it. You’re our customer, not our product.
